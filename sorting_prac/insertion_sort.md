The error in the code arises because `jdx` is an unsigned integer (`usize`), and when it becomes zero, decrementing it (which is what happens in your `while` loop) will cause an underflow, resulting in an invalid index (since `usize` can't be negative).

In Rust, you canâ€™t have a negative index, so you need to handle the situation where `jdx` becomes negative. Instead of using `usize` for `jdx`, you can use an `isize` type (signed integer) to allow it to go below zero, or handle the decrement in a safer way.

Also, the expression `jdx = jdx + loc_list.len() - 1 % loc_list.len()` is not correct and should just be `jdx -= 1` to decrement the index.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

### Corrected `insertion_sort` function:

```rust
pub fn insertion_sort(in_list: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut loc_list = in_list;

    // Start with the second element of the list (index 1)
    for idx in 1..loc_list.len() {
        let key = loc_list[idx];
        let mut jdx = idx as isize - 1; // Using isize to handle negative values

        // Move elements of loc_list[0..idx], that are greater than key, to one position ahead
        while jdx >= 0 && loc_list[jdx as usize] > key {
            loc_list[(jdx + 1) as usize] = loc_list[jdx as usize];
            jdx -= 1;
        }

        // Insert the key at the correct location
        loc_list[(jdx + 1) as usize] = key;
    }

    loc_list
}
```

### Key Corrections:

1. **Index Handling (`jdx` as `isize`):**
   
   - Changed `jdx` to `isize` to handle the case where it goes below 0. When `jdx` becomes `-1`, the loop stops because `jdx >= 0` will no longer be true.

2. **Decrementing `jdx`:**
   
   - Corrected the decrement of `jdx` in the `while` loop: `jdx -= 1` instead of the erroneous `jdx = jdx + loc_list.len() - 1 % loc_list.len()`.

3. **Index Casting:**
   
   - In the `while` loop, cast `jdx` to `usize` when accessing elements of the vector because `isize` can be negative, while indices in Rust must be non-negative (`usize`).

### Example Usage:

```rust
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![12, 11, 13, 5, 6];
    let sorted_vec = insertion_sort(vec);
    println!("{:?}", sorted_vec); // Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
}
```

### Explanation:

- The `for` loop starts from the second element (`idx = 1`) and goes through each element in the list.
- The `while` loop compares the current key with the previous elements and shifts larger elements one position to the right.
- When the correct position for the key is found, it is inserted into the list.

This corrected version should work as expected without errors.
